      In emerging markets, professional services often lag behind business innovation. Traditional service providers struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving business models and technology-driven changes. This creates real challenges:
    <% end %>

    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Text.new(tag: :ul, classes: "principle-list")) do %>
      <li>Outdated approaches that don't match modern business needs</li>
      <li>Service models that prioritize process over practical solutions</li>
      <li>Limited understanding of technology-driven business models</li>
      <li>Gaps between local requirements and international standards</li>
      <li>Risk-averse mindsets that hinder innovation</li>
    <% end %>

    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Text.new(tag: :p, classes: "principle-text")) do %>
      This service gap affects businesses in tangible ways:
    <% end %>

    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Text.new(tag: :ul, classes: "principle-list")) do %>
      <li>Delayed market entry and missed opportunities</li>
      <li>Complex structures that don't match business realities</li>
      <li>Insufficient support for rapid scaling</li>
      <li>Limited guidance on innovative business models</li>
      <li>Unclear paths through regulatory requirements</li>
    <% end %>

    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Heading.new(tag: :h2, mb: 2)) { "A Growing Need" } %>
    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Text.new(tag: :p, classes: "principle-text")) do %>
      Fast-moving businesses need service partners who:
    <% end %>

    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Text.new(tag: :ul, classes: "principle-list")) do %>
      <li>Understand technology and innovation fundamentals</li>
      <li>Balance compliance with practical business needs</li>
      <li>Provide solutions that enable rather than restrict</li>
      <li>Think globally while acting locally</li>
      <li>Move at the speed of business</li>
    <% end %>

    <%= render(Primer::Beta::Text.new(tag: :p, classes: "principle-text")) do %>
      This service deficit particularly affects innovators and builders - those creating new business models or entering emerging markets. They need advisors who grasp both traditional professional requirements and modern business dynamics.
